### What is it needed to do?

It is asked to build a simple survey form, [similar to this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP) published on Codepen, to practice previous lessons of the Responsive Web Design module on freeCodeCamp.

### Required steps from the [project's rubric](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) to pass the tests in the proveded test suite:

1. I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.
2. I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.
3. I can see a form with id="survey-form".
4. Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".
5. Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".
6. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
7. Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".
8. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
9. If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
10. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".
11. For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
12. Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".
13. Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
14. Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.
15. Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.
16. Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.

### freeCodeCamp test suite

Available at this link:
